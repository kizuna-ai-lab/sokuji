## Key Findings

1. **Three Echo Sources Identified:**
   - Passthrough mechanism (~20ms delay)
   - AI response playback (500-2000ms delay)
   - Cumulative audio degradation

2. **Browser AEC Limitations:**
   - Cannot process AudioWorkletNode-generated audio
   - Missing reference signal for echo cancellation
   - Standard constraints ineffective for programmatic audio

3. **Recommended Solution:**
   - Headphone usage provides 100% effective physical isolation
   - No performance impact or code changes required
   - Already implemented in UI warning system
