# Profile Data Optimization

## Changes Made

### Before
- Fetched user data from `/api/user/profile` endpoint
- Fetched quota data from `/api/usage/quota` endpoint
- Duplicated user data between Clerk and backend
- Required manual refresh when Clerk data updated

### After
- User data comes directly from Clerk's `useUser()` hook
- Only fetch quota data from `/api/usage/quota` endpoint
- No data duplication - single source of truth
- Automatic updates when Clerk data changes

## Benefits

1. **Reduced API Calls**: From 2 API calls to 1
2. **Real-time Updates**: User data automatically updates when changed in Clerk UI
3. **Better Performance**: Less network latency, faster initial load
4. **Simplified Code**: Removed complex refresh logic and state management
5. **Data Consistency**: No sync issues between Clerk and backend

## Implementation Details

### UserProfileContext
- Removed `fetchProfile` function
- Simplified to only fetch quota data
- User data transformed directly from Clerk's user object
- Subscription read from `user.publicMetadata.subscription`

### UserAccountInfo Component
- Reads user data from transformed Clerk data
- Only loading state for quota fetching
- Cleaner, more maintainable code

## Testing

1. Sign in to the application
2. Check that user info displays correctly
3. Check that subscription shows correctly
4. Check that quota loads and displays
5. Update user info in Clerk UI (via UserButton)
6. Verify that changes appear immediately without manual refresh

## Data Flow

```
Clerk API → useUser() hook → UserProfileContext → Components
Backend API → /api/usage/quota → UserProfileContext → Components
```

User data flows directly from Clerk, while only quota data requires backend API.
