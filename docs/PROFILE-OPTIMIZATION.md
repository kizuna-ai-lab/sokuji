# Profile Data Optimization

> **Note**: This document was originally written for Clerk integration. Now using Better Auth with similar optimization principles.

## Changes Made

### Before
- Fetched user data from `/api/user/profile` endpoint
- Fetched quota data from `/api/usage/quota` endpoint
- Duplicated user data between authentication provider and backend
- Required manual refresh when user data updated

### After
- User data comes directly from Better Auth's `useUser()` hook
- Only fetch quota data from `/api/usage/quota` endpoint
- No data duplication - single source of truth
- Automatic updates when Better Auth session changes

## Benefits

1. **Reduced API Calls**: From 2 API calls to 1
2. **Real-time Updates**: User data automatically updates when Better Auth session changes
3. **Better Performance**: Less network latency, faster initial load
4. **Simplified Code**: Removed complex refresh logic and state management
5. **Data Consistency**: No sync issues between Better Auth and backend

## Implementation Details

### UserProfileContext
- Removed `fetchProfile` function
- Simplified to only fetch quota data
- User data transformed directly from Better Auth's user object
- Subscription and user metadata managed by Better Auth

### UserAccountInfo Component
- Reads user data from Better Auth session
- Only loading state for quota fetching
- Cleaner, more maintainable code

## Testing

1. Sign in to the application
2. Check that user info displays correctly
3. Check that subscription shows correctly
4. Check that quota loads and displays
5. Update user info (via profile management)
6. Verify that changes appear after session refresh

## Data Flow

```
Better Auth API → useUser() hook → UserProfileContext → Components
Backend API → /api/usage/quota → UserProfileContext → Components
```

User data flows directly from Better Auth session, while only quota data requires backend API.
