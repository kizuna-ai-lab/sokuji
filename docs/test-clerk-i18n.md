## Verification Steps

2. **Check Japanese**: Switch to 日本語 and go to /sign-in - should show Japanese text
3. **Check French**: Switch to Français and go to /sign-in - should show French text
4. **Check Fallback**: Switch to Filipino and go to /sign-in - should show English text

## Notes

- The localization is loaded dynamically only when needed
- Loaded localizations are cached for performance
- The console logs help debug which languages are loading
- @clerk/localizations is marked as experimental by Clerk
