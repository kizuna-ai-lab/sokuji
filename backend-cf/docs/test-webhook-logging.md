# Webhook Logging Implementation Test

## Overview

The webhook logging implementation has been successfully added to record all incoming Clerk webhook events in the database.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Database Schema
- **webhook_logs** table with comprehensive logging fields
- Event identification with idempotency support
- Processing status tracking (pending, success, failed)
- Raw payload storage for debugging
- Metadata fields for audit trail

### 2. Webhook Handler Updates
- **Idempotency Check**: Prevents duplicate processing using event_id
- **Immediate Logging**: Records webhook before processing
- **Status Tracking**: Updates status after processing completion
- **Error Handling**: Records failures with error messages
- **Request Metadata**: Stores headers, IP address, and signatures

### 3. Management Endpoints
- **GET /webhook-logs**: Paginated webhook log retrieval (admin only)
- **GET /webhook-stats**: Webhook processing statistics (admin only)
- **POST /webhook-logs/:id/retry**: Retry failed webhooks (admin only)

## Database Migration

To add the webhook logging to existing databases, run:
```bash
# For development
wrangler d1 execute sokuji-db-dev --file=./schema/add_webhook_logs.sql --config wrangler.dev.toml

# For production
wrangler d1 execute sokuji-db-prod --file=./schema/add_webhook_logs.sql
```

## Testing Webhook Logging

### 1. Verify Table Creation
```sql
-- Check if webhook_logs table exists
SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table' AND name='webhook_logs';

-- View table schema
.schema webhook_logs
```

### 2. Monitor Incoming Webhooks
```sql
-- View recent webhooks
SELECT event_id, event_type, processing_status, created_at 
FROM webhook_logs 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 10;

-- Check processing status counts
SELECT processing_status, COUNT(*) as count 
FROM webhook_logs 
GROUP BY processing_status;
```

### 3. API Testing
```bash
# Get webhook logs (requires admin auth)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  https://your-domain.com/auth/webhook-logs?limit=10

# Get webhook statistics
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  https://your-domain.com/auth/webhook-stats
```

## Benefits

1. **Complete Audit Trail**: Every webhook event is recorded with full payload
2. **Debugging Support**: Raw payloads available for troubleshooting failed events
3. **Idempotency**: Prevents duplicate processing of the same event
4. **Monitoring**: Statistics and status tracking for operational visibility
5. **Recovery**: Ability to identify and retry failed webhook processing

## Data Retention

Consider implementing data retention policies for webhook logs:
- Keep detailed logs for 30-90 days
- Archive older logs with reduced detail
- Purge very old logs to manage storage

## Security Considerations

- Webhook logs contain sensitive user data - ensure proper access controls
- API keys in payloads should be masked or redacted if present
- Admin-only endpoints require proper authentication
- Consider encrypting raw_payload field for additional security

## Implementation Status

✅ Database schema created
✅ Migration script provided
✅ Webhook handler updated with logging
✅ Idempotency protection implemented
✅ Error handling and status tracking
✅ Management endpoints for monitoring
✅ Testing documentation provided

The implementation is complete and ready for deployment. All Clerk webhook events will now be recorded in the database for audit, debugging, and monitoring purposes.
