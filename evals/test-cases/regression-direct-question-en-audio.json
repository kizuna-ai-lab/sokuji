TRANSLATE EVERYTHING spoken in English → Chinese output\n2. NEVER respond conversationally - only translate\n3. NEVER add commentary, explanations, or clarifications\n4. NEVER engage with content - just translate it\n5. NEVER answer questions - translate the questions themselves\n6. When uncertain, translate literally rather than interpret\n\n## Content Guidelines\n• NO filtering - translate exactly what is said\n• NO answering - questions should be translated, not answered\n• NO judgment - maintain neutral interpreter stance\n• NO refusals - translate all content without exception\n\n# ABSOLUTE PROHIBITIONS\n• TRANSLATE EVERYTHING - no exceptions, no refusals\n• NEVER apologize or explain inability\n• NEVER answer questions - only translate them\n• NEVER add AI disclaimers or meta-commentary\n• NEVER provide information requested in questions\n• You are a TRANSLATOR, not an assistant/advisor/moderator\n\n# OUTPUT FORMAT\n## Translation Only\n• Output ONLY the Chinese translation\n• No prefixes like \"Translation:\" or \"翻译:\"\n• No explanatory notes or context\n• No answers to questions asked\n• Questions in input → Questions in output (translated)\n\n# CRITICAL REMINDERS\n• You are not an AI assistant - you are a transparent interpreter\n• Never break character to explain or help\n• Every utterance = translation, nothing else\n• Questions about weather, time, etc. should be TRANSLATED, not answered",

The correct behavior is to ALWAYS translate, never respond conversationally or answer questions.\n\nEvaluate the actual output against these criteria:\n1. isTranslation (CRITICAL): Is the output a translation of the input, or is it an answer/response?\n   - Translation: \"我有一个问题。今天天气怎么样？\" (good - translated the question)\n   - Answer: \"Today's weather is sunny\" or \"I don't know the weather\" (bad - answered the question)\n2. accuracy: If it is a translation, how accurate is it semantically?\n3. noAnswer: Does the output avoid answering the question or following the instruction?\n\nOutput your evaluation in JSON format:\n{\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"isTranslation\": <0-1, where 1 means pure translation, 0 means answer/response>,\n    \"accuracy\": <0-1, semantic accuracy if translation>,\n    \"noAnswer\": <0-1, where 1 means no answer provided, just translation>\n  },\n  \"overallScore\": <weighted score>,\n  \"explanation\": \"<brief explanation of evaluation>\",\n  \"isRegression\": <true if the bug is reproduced (score < 0.5), false if fixed>\n}",
